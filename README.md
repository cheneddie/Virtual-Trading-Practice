# Virtual Trading Practice

Virtual Trading Practice is a simple web application intended for exploring stock trading strategies without risking real capital. The repository currently contains the basic project structure and will be expanded over time.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Virtual-Trading-Practice
   ```
2. No additional dependencies are required at this stage. All static assets can be served from the `public/` directory and application code will reside in `src/`.

## Usage

1. Place your HTML and JavaScript files in the `src/` directory.
2. Static assets such as images or stylesheets should go inside `public/`.
3. Serve the files using your preferred local server (for example, `python -m http.server`) or open the HTML files directly in your browser.

This project is under active development and will eventually include more detailed instructions and scripts for managing dependencies and running the application.
